# OBS-YTMusic-Popup

Creates a YTMusic popup that shows what song you are listening to on stream

# Installation
1. Clone repository
2. Setup YTMusic API oauth: https://ytmusicapi.readthedocs.io/en/stable/setup/index.html
3. Setup OBS Websockets: https://obsproject.com/kb/developer-guide
4. Install dependencies (requirments.txt using "pip install -r requirements.txt")
5. Setup Enviromental Variables

# Notes
1. OBS HAS to be open
2. You do need to create the source yourself
    Folder named Music with all sources you want to be shown
    "MusicText" for text source unless you change the code
4. I have F8 set to stop the loop but I just recommend closing the terminal

# Shoutouts
1. DougDoug for most of OBS Websockets code (I was struggling to figure it out)
2. Me because I learned a lot
